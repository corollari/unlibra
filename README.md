> Stable cross-border layer2 payments brought to your closest social network

## Features
### Stable
Uses DAI for all payments, a decentralized stablecoin built through collateralizion mechanisms on ETH

### Cross-border
Not a traditional financial instrument -> Not shackled by everything that financial stuff is.

### Layer2
It is based on Statechains ^[https://tokyo2018.scalingbitcoin.org/files/Day2/statechains.pdf], a layer two protocol ported to ethereum by me. This allows for free (as in beer) and instant transactions.

### Social network
Integrated directly into the Facebook chat widget, which provides:
	- Extremely good UX for all users
	- Huge network effects

This is done via a browser extension that directly modifies facebook's page.
